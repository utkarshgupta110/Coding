# 💻 Coding Practice Repository – DSA & Programming

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my complete coding practice across multiple programming languages.  
It includes Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), core programming concepts, and problem-solving exercises implemented in **C++, Java, Python, C, and Web Technologies**.

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Strengthen problem-solving skills
- Master DSA concepts
- Prepare for coding interviews and placements
- Maintain organized coding practice in one place
